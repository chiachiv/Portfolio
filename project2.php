            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The design concept for this project was to create a simple and accessible medical mobile application for self-diagnosis. The app starts with an AI-driven questionnaire to help users understand their symptoms and connects them to a live chat with an expert to avoid dangerous self-diagnosis. Additionally, the app assists users in finding nearby clinics for immediate care and allows them to keep track of their health in a "health journal."<br><br>

            <h2 class="proj-title">UX Research</h2>
            <p>This was a project I completed during my masterâ€™s degree for the User Experience and Service Design module. It is a service that helps people to understand better their symptoms and that can help them to take the right action, it also can help to avoid <strong>dangerous self-diagnosis</strong>. In fact, people usually relay on Google when it comes to find a quick solution to their problems. This could be very dangerous because usually typing symptoms as a research on the internet does not give the user an accurate and safe solution.</p>
            <p>The plan was made to reflect the <strong>design thinking five stage process</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p class="p-persona">Maria is a 45-year-old woman that lives in Edinburgh. She is married with two kids. She is always very busy because she needs to manage her job which is very stressful, but it is something that she really enjoys, and her family with two kids that are still going to school.</p>
                    <p class="p-persona">She is always struggling to manage everything, and she is also an individual that suffer of anxiety. She is especially anxious when it comes to health problems. She owns a smartphone and her kids helped her to understand some features and how it works.</p>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h3 class="p-title">Scenario</h3>
                <p class="p-persona">Maria one morning started to suffer of a <strong>bad headache</strong> but after dropping her kids at school she still decided to go to work. During the whole day she was still feeling bad and because of her anxiety she started to panic.</p>
                <p class="p-persona">She reached her phone to type in <strong>her symptoms</strong> on Google, but all the research could not address properly her problems. This made her anxiety even worse because she started reading about <strong>disastrous diagnoses</strong>. At that point she would call her GP and schedule an appointment for another day <strong>without knowing</strong> exactly what the problem is. So, she would end her day even more anxious waiting for the doctor appointment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scenario">
                <h3 class="p-title">Goal</h3>
                <p class="p-persona">Because Maria is very busy with her job and her family sometimes even making an appointment can be very troublesome. She would like to manage her health problems in a way that is not disruptive for her routine, especially because she is very anxious.</p>
                <p class="p-persona">She would also like to <strong>keep track</strong> of her health journey in one single place so an app can be very helpful. Being an individual that suffers of terrible anxiety, having <strong>a service that can support the whole process</strong> of knowing what your symptoms are, making an appointment, etc. can be extremely helpful for Maria. She also would like to stop feeding her anxiety by doing <strong>incorrect self-diagnosis</strong>, so having an expert support by just opening an app on her phone could be very helpful.</p>

        <h2 class="fin-title">Method:</h2>
        <p>10 open-ended questions were asked to 8 respondents, aged between 20 and 57.</p>
        <h2 class="fin-title">Findings:</h2>
<p>All respondents found the idea useful and said they would use it. However, most noted that <strong>older users</strong> might struggle with the app. They suggested a clean, simple design to aid usability. 80% believed that <strong>chatting with a real expert</strong> could prevent dangerous self-diagnosis. Additionally, 30% recommended a <strong>"health journal"</strong> feature to track visits and bills, which was incorporated into the final product and iterated upon during development.</p>

            <p>For this project, our team created a mobile application designed to help students find the perfect <strong>internship</strong>, making the transition from study to career smoother.</p>
            <p>I focused on the <strong>UX/UI design</strong> and <strong>frontend development</strong>, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a clean, intuitive interface that prioritized ease of use for students.</p>
            <p>We aimed to deliver a <strong>user-friendly</strong> experience while integrating <strong>machine learning</strong> to match students with suitable internships.</p>
            <p>Although we faced some <strong>challenges</strong> and made changes to our initial plan, the final product effectively met our goals, providing a valuable tool for students navigating their career paths.</p>
